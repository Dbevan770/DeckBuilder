# DeckBuilder

Description of Project: 

Summary: The program helps you generate a deck for Star Wars Cards, where you pick and chose 60 cards from your collection to go fight other player's decks.
 
The program asks the user how many cards of the 60 card deck they would like the system to automatically generate for them. 

It then creates an array of Cards, an abstract class with 3 derived classes (one for locations, another for characters, and a third for interrupts).  It calls a default constructor and auto fills the required properties of each card type generated.  

If the user selected less than the required 60 cards, the system will ask them to manually enter details for the remaining cards, and then passes the user entered data into an overloaded constructor.

When the deck is complete, the system converts the array of cards into a stack and asks the user what they want to do next.  Currently, it supports displaying the deck, shuffling, peeking at the top card, and drawing an opening hand.

The project utilizes the following C# / Object Oreinted Principals: 
   Instantiation 
   Polymorphism
   Inheritance
   Enums
   Randomization
   Stacks
   Arrays
   String Validation
   Overloading
   Abstraction

Some features have not been implemented in the interest of time. I will update as time permits.
